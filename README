quick: ./install.sh and run "./run-theory.sh start" .  Then direct your browser 
to http://localhost:9099/ if you're running theory locally

This is only my third Python project and my second Pylons app.  Suggestions / bug fixes / pointing out 
my non-Pythonic idioms are all welcome.  Most layout values / colors are in the CSS file theory/public/css/styles.css.  
I'd like to add support for themes, but you should be able to edit the CSS file if you don't like the color scheme.

theory is Firefox only for now. I have no desire to support IE and I don't have access to any OSX-based browsers.  

known bugs:
    * the Python-MPD library doesn't properly handle unicode in artist/album queries.  If you have tags that
      use unicode it's suggested that you simplify them, unfortunately.
    * there is a bug in jquery that will throw an "easing" error occasionally
