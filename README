quick: ./install.sh and run "./run-theory.sh start" .  Then direct your browser 
to http://localhost:9099/ if you're running theory locally

notes:
	* This is only my third Python project and my second Pylons app.  Suggestions / bug fixes / pointing out 
	  my non-Pythonic idioms are all welcome.  Most layout values / colors are in the CSS file theory/public/css/styles.css.  
	  I'd like to add support for themes, but you should be able to edit the CSS file if you don't like the color scheme.

	* theory is Firefox only for now. I have no desire to support IE and I don't have access to any OSX-based browsers. 
	  jquery is cross-browser so Opera should work pretty well, but I haven't tested it. 

known bugs:
    * there is a bug in jquery that will throw an "easing" error occasionally 

upgrading:
	* if you're upgrading from a previous version of theory, you might want to copy your theory.ini over from the 
	  old installation directory. Server info, Amazon AWS key, and saved streams are stored in that file. You should also
	  consider copying the downloaded album art stored in theory-OLDVERSION/theory/public/img/art/  to avoid 
	  re-downloading all of those images.
